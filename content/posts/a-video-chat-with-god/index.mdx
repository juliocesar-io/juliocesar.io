A weekly video chat with God <br/>
Will that suffice? – _she asked_ <br/>

Your voice isn't yours <br/>
No fair role <br/>
No rebel love <br/>
Within cells shall bursts <br/>

_Within cells interlinked_ <br/>
Wasn't him, _Sisyphus in love_? <br/>

Let the maths thrive <br/>
As a rock is never hostile <br/>
You reckon, did _Christ_ ever smile? <br/>
At the glimpse of a seduced eye <br/>

Did the divine came from the sand <br/>
Did the sand from the rocks? <br/>
Not even your sight lurks <br/>
Yet healthy, body unharmed

Human, what's that you lack of? <br/>

A life by the minute <br/>
The soldier's minute <br/>
Live for nothing <br/>
Die for nothing <br/>

Maybe a doctor for the soul will suffice this time <br/>
Apprehend from _Caligula_ <br/>

The anguish of existing as such <br/>
Of suffering as such <br/>
But, questions such as <br/>
How much can you suffer? <br/>
_– Always more_ <br/>
How much can you rejoice ? <br/>
_– Only an inch_ <br/>

You may feel astray <br/>
Derail to indulgence <br/>
Entangle with prudence <br/>
But empty you stay <br/>

_- Again, untouched_

(_Diotima_ joins the videochat) <br/>

Desire wisdom <br/>
Tell me, you seek God because you think God is love? <br/>

I gaze at this world <br/>
Loads of smiles <br/>
Loads of pleasures <br/>
Orderliness and sense of progress <br/>

Christ did die <br/>
So you and God can smile <br/>
But, I am afraid <br/>
Love is not a God at all <br/>
Neither wise nor _beautiful_ <br/>

Tenderness of the spirit, that's love! <br/>
Yes, a desire it is <br/>
_The_ center of the world <br/>
A desire for knowledge <br/>
Out of all there _is_ <br/>
Out of _all_ that could be <br/>
It is in fact <br/>
A constant video chat with God

<br />
